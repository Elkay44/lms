# Company Description

## Company History
Founded in 2020, SkyMirror emerged from a vision to transform how businesses and communities across the globe leverage technology. What began as a small team of passionate technologists has rapidly evolved into a dynamic global enterprise. The founders identified critical gaps in technology access, particularly in emerging markets, and recognized the transformative potential of combining cutting-edge software development, AI applications, and educational initiatives under one cohesive brand.

Today, SkyMirror operates across multiple continents, serving clients ranging from startups to established enterprises while simultaneously empowering communities through educational programs designed to bridge the global digital divide.
